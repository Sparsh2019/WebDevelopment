Use this md to tell us the bugs you solved and also explain the approach you had while solving them. Make them bulleted like

1. Accessibility - \* Changed the icon-menu using class as icon-menu instead of icon-list and also changed the .icon-menu:before content using the icomoon app

2. Aesthetics - **Something here**
3. Testing - **Something here**
4. Technicality Improvements - \* Changed the links in the nav menu,refer Handlebars docs

- When the menu icon is clicked on, we need to toggle a class on the body to perform the hiding/showing of our menu.
